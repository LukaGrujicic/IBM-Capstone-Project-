    "As we can see from the Reuslts section the neighbourhoods of NYC are much more spread out and lesser than those of Toronto which are densley packed together. Using K-Means Clustering and 4Square API i was able to extract the top 10 venuse from each neighbourhood and segment the neighbourhoods into 5 seperate clusters which were subsequerntly colured and mapped out using the folium package. The major diffrence that we can see in the two cities is the denstiy of the neighbourhoods and the higher number of neighbourhoods in each cluster for toronto where we see that the downtown core is specifically grouped together and then the surrounding neighbourhoods are all of one cluster this leads us to belive that the neighbourhoods outside of the city are mainly of 1 culture versus the downtown core is of another wheras in NYC we see the clear segmentation of cultures int he downtown core which is more diverse"

    "I feel rewarded with the efforts and believe this course with all the topics covered is well worthy of appreciation. This project has shown me a practical application to resolve a real situation that has a personal impact using Data Science tools. The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision better with confidence.\n"
