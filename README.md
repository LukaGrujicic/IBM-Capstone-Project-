IBM Data Science Profesional Capstone project 

Using 4Sqaure API and Data off of Wikipedia created a K-Means clustering program that Maps and Groups Toronto Neighbourhoods using their postal codes and finds the top 10 venues in each of the neighbourhoods and clusters them based on the similarity of venues. 

Venues are defined as shops or restaraunts (i.e Chineese restaruant,Lounge,Coffee shop)

The results are plotted on a map and this was used to compare the similarity of Toronto and New York to compare and contrast the diversity in the two cities
